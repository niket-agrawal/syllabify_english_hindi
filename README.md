# Python benchmarks for English/Hindi syllable counters and syllabification methods

## 1. English syllabification methods

**1.1 There exists mainly 4 categories of methods:**
- Dictionary searches, e.g. CMU dict
- Hyphenation methods, e.g. PyHyphen - https://www.tug.org/docs/liang/liang-thesis.pdf
- ML based approaches, non explanability
- Rule based approaches, fast and might be inaccurate, e.g. Sonority Sequencing by nltk

**1.2 We have tested the following packages and libraries for English:**
- `nltk` **sonority** based and **cmu** dict
- `indic` lib
- hyphenation libraries, `pyphen` and `hyphenate`
- `spacy` machine learning models, **spacy_syllable** and **nlp pipeline**
- machine learning models, `meow25` and `bigphoney`
- user contributions over internet, `basirico`, `anonuser1`, `abigailb`, `hauntninja` and `tarun`
- misc libs, `syllapy` and `syllables`

**1.3 Some packages syllabify and count, others just count syllables:**
